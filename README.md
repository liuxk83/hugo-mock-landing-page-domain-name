# FlavorForge
## by Kevin Liu

This repo contains a [landing page](https://flavorforge.xyz/) for FlavorForge, an (imaginary) product that 3D-prints delicious meals.
Made using the static site generator Hugo and [Felipe Carneiro's Bootstrap theme](https://github.com/filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme).

This repo builds on [another repo](https://github.com/liuxk83/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed) (which itself is based on [this repo](https://github.com/liuxk83/hugo-mock-landing-page)) by using a custom domain for deployment.
